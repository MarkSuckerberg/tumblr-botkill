# Tumblr Botkiller

This simple bot runs as a cloudflare worker and, using OAuth2, gets all accounts following you that have both no posts
and aren't followed by you.

Made in two days without a proper TS library or any real knowledge of OAuth at the time. Use at your own risk.

Subject to being updated when I get around to making a proper typed tumblr OAuth2 library since I'm pretty sure that
the official JS lib only supports OAuth1.0A which is a PAIN to work with.
